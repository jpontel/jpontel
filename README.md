### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JosÃ© Rodrigo Pontel

I'm a Software developer with a deep passion for the design, creation, and maintenance of both mobile and web systems, with a strong focus on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. My expertise extends to the dynamic world of AI and web development, where I enjoy exploring the potential of Python, React, and TensorFlow to create intelligent and intuitive applications that make a difference in people's lives.

With a keen interest in both functional applications and the transformative power of AI, I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects. Whether it's a cutting-edge NLP solution, a data-driven application, or an intuitive web/mobile interface, I'd love to hear from you! Let's build something impactful together. ;D
