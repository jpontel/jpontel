### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JosÃ© Rodrigo Pontel

I'm a Software developer with a deep passion for the design, creation, and maintenance of both mobile and web systems. My expertise extends to the thrilling world of game and web development, where I enjoy exploring the potential of Swift, C++, React and Python to create engaging gaming experiences.

With a keen interest in both functional applications and the interactive art of game design, I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects. If you have an interesting idea, whether it's a cutting-edge web/mobile application or an immersive game, please get in touch with me! ;D
